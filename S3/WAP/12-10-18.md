## Types of scientific literature

* more on **Journal Articles**
    * No parallel submissions - journals cross check this (might also get same reviewer), will throw out prallel submissions
        * Tells story of some PhD student he advised and got asked to review that guy's paper by 2 journals - ratted the guy out
* *Open Access* - papers are published for anyone for free
    * under licenses covered below
    * Journals impose *article processing costs* (~$2k, usually covered by grants)
        * APCs have gone up recently - nice source of income for publishers
* **Collections** - like journals, but more content (basically a 300-500p book)
    * initial *call for papers* where anybody can submit one
* **Conference papers** - your stuff *needs* to be new
    * Conferences are organized by professional societies (in CS: IEEECS, ACM), these install *conference chair* (main coordinator), program committee, organization committee
    * Organization process:
        1. Conference chair is in charge of making the conference known
        2. Organizing committee is in charge of the physical location etc. Can be hard - conferences range from <100 to 50k+ people, they make sure there's enough space in hotels, food, tech (backup projectors etc...)
            * Conferences are held in changing locations - two reasons: touristic appeal of the place; 
        3. Program committee calls for papers
        4. some prominent speakers might get invited to give a talk
        
Some commonly (hehe) used open access licenses:

[Licenses]

--- missed a couple things here (till p.35 on slides) ---

* **Technical Reports** 
    * since papers take a while to publish, technical reports are a way to quickly publish *something*
    * to be taken with a grain of salt - no QC, if the report didn't make it into any journal etc then it's likely not to be trusted (likely something is wrong somewhere)
    * Tech reps are a dying breed though - archive services are replacing them (e.g. arXiv)
* **Master's thesis**
    * [Typical bachelor's thesis does not fit into research work, hence only master is mentioned here]
    * Demonstrates author's ability to do scientific work
    * Original results are desirable but not required
* **PhD thesis**
    * Demonstrates author's ability to attain original results (required!). 
* **Habilitation thesis**
    * To demonstrate that you are an established researcher in your field. Not really known outside of central europe - called *tenure* in the States
* **Patents**
    * are completely rewritten in "legalese", not much science left in them

### Problems of current publishing scheme

* **Publish or perish**
    * Dubious conferences - cash cows for organizers and travel companies; poor to no refereeing
    * Open access - shift of payment duty. Used to be pay to read, now pay to publish
    * Certin publishers hold loads of [crappy] conferences, publish loads of papers
    * [Online paper generator][1] - these papers do get accepted by many [crappy] open-access journals
    * No real solution is ready
    * This leads to too many publications and journals
        * ~3M submissions per year but only ~450K staff
        * ~500 new journals are started every year
        * Too much to be comprehended in its entirety by researches (even if only a few journals are relevant for one)
* Quality control based on reviews
    * Referees might be ignorant (see: [We are sorry to inform you...][2])
    * Humans make honest mistakes

### Searching for literature

* ISBNs: consist of 978 prefix, geographical region, publisher, publication, checkdigit
* URLs: store location of the document, not document itself - page might die or structure of the site rearranged
    * Solution - Digital Object Identifier (DOI) - unique and persistent name of a document, can access file via a DOI resolver
        * Are actually used in academia
 * Required bibliographical data of monographs: names of authors and editors, title, edition, publisher, ISBN, name of series/number of book within series
    * series is important - see [Springer Lecture Notes on Computer Science][3]
