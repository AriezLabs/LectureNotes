## Names + Heap

Understanding names on an abstract level is critical to understanding the compilation process

static <-> dynamic memory: refers to "layout"

Stack goes downwards and back up as code is executed. Below is the heap ("haufen") - a lot more complicated, efficient heap management is complicated.

#### How are names managed?

Example Hello World Program introduces two names: `foo` and `main`. System must somehow figure out how many bytes the corresponding values are going to need. Types define how operators behave. E.g. for a pointer in C, adding `1` to it will raise it by 8 bytes (points to the next word in memory). 

*Declaring vs. defining*: For methods, the definition is the code. -> Tells us way more about the "thing". The definition produces a connection between a name and some value

*Symbol Table*: Creates a list data structure for each entry in it. Each node holds a name and whatever the names are supposed to be (type, ...). Takes O(n) for lookup. Now changed to a hash table because lookup was 30% of compilation time. The hash function looks at the first 8 characters of a string. 

## Types

Types regulate behavior of operators. What type will `10` be in `x < 10`, if `x` is an integer, a pointer, ...?

In selfie comparing an unsigned integer with -1 returns "fuzzy" results: `1 < -1` returns `True`, since -1 as an unsigned integer is the largest number you can get as `uint`

Now: Done with this for now. That was needed foundations in order to understand what OSs do: they are software that run arbitrary amounts of programs in parallel along with themselves... how is this done? That's the actual goal of this course
