### LectureNotes

Collection of incomplete lecture notes written in German and/or English. Solutions to some of the homework are included. Any errors are likely mine. Most notes and solutions are unreviewed. Layout is still evolving and thus inconsistent. Use at your own peril.

Some notes will not display properly on GitHub. Prettier PDF versions coming later. There is a sample PDF for testing/previewing purposes (created with [Marked 2][1]): DB2/23-10-2018_PS_PDFTEST.pdf
