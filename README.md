### LectureNotes

Collection of incomplete lecture notes written in German and/or English. Solutions to some of the homework are included. Any errors are most likely mine. Most notes and solutions are unreviewed. Layout is still evolving and thus inconsistent. Use at your own peril.

Some notes will not display properly on GitHub due to lack of MathJax support. There are prettier PDF versions for some of these lectures.
