## C/C++

* `repo/` holds assignments as well as solutions
* `script/` represents my attempt to learn C and C++. The notes are reference style and incomplete. 
* Markdown lecture notes have been taken sparsely since there are very thorough "official" lecture notes already available at https://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~rkutil/ccpp18/ccpp.pdf
