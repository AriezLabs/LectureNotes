## C/C++

This is supposed to become a collection of notes taken in the process of attempting to learn C and C++ (to a higher degree than a 2h-a-week lecture allows). As of now however this subdirectory only holds material covered in the associated lecture, but I aim to extend it later with notes on material from selected textbooks on the topic.

```script_notes.md``` is the single file which holds all of my notes on the script. Due to (*ahem*) circumstances I expect my lecture attendance to be rather irregular, but of course notes will be taken whenever I manage. There will obviously be large amounts of overlap between lecture notes and those taken while studying the script.
